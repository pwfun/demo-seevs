# Getting Started

Welcome to our developer documentation! This demo shows how easy it is to maintain docs-as-code.

## What is docs-as-code?

Docs-as-code means treating documentation with the same workflow as code:

- **Version control** - Every change is tracked in Git
- **Pull requests** - Changes are reviewed before merging
- **Automation** - Docs deploy automatically when merged
- **Markdown** - Simple, readable format anyone can learn

## Why docs-as-code?

Traditional CMS platforms like Drupal can be heavyweight for documentation. With docs-as-code:

- Developers can contribute using familiar tools (Git, Markdown, VS Code)
- Non-technical users can edit directly in GitHub's web interface
- Changes are reviewed and approved before going live
- Version history is built-in
- Docs live alongside code in the same repository

## Quick start

To make a change to these docs:

1. Click the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of any page
2. Make your changes in GitHub's editor
3. Preview your changes
4. Submit a pull request
5. Once approved and merged, changes deploy automatically

It's that simple!

This is a demonsttration of docs-as-codee.
